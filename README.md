Basic-How-To Calculating Linear Regression Model


# What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is one of the basic statistical analysis.
It can examine whether a set of independent variables is correlated with the dependent variable.

The most common formula to calculate the model is running the formula 
```markdown
y = c + b*x
```
where :
y = estimated dependent variable score, 
c = constant, 
b = regression coefficient, 
x = score on the independent variable.
